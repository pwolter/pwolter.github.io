Thank you for being here. I hope you enjoyed what you read!

I am a software engineer interested in big data and analytics as a whole. I like data science, machine learning and all in between.

On my spare time I scuba dive, both recreational and technically. I play ice hockey, run, bike, and snowboard. When seated still, I like to read, listen music and learn new skills.

I am from Chile, but moved around due different reasons. Some are intolerance and some my own choices. I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States. I like it here.

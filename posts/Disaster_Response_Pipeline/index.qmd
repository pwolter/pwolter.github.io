# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

![](Message_distribution.png)

In this project, we analyzed disaster data provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The provided data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. We have created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that users of the application can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency to take proper and timely action.

The project includes a web application were an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web application also displays visualizations of the data. The code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/pwolter/DisasterRecovery)

## Libraries used

We have used the following libraries besides the regular Python Data Science stack:

- Scikit learn
- NLTK
- sqlalchemy
- Flask
- pickle 0.20
- Plotly
- argparser

To install them just run:

```bash
pip install -u scikit-learn nltk sqlalchemy flask pickleshare plotly
```

## Project description

The project is divided into three main components:

### 1. ETL Pipeline

A Python script, `process_data.py`, contains the data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the messages and categories datasets
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in an SQLite database

### 2. ML Pipeline

A Python script, `train_classifier.py`, that holds the code of the machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the SQLite database saved before
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

### 3. Flask Web App

Holds the code of the **Web Interface** from which the end-user will enter the message's text to get the predictions. This page will guide the emergency worker providing predictions about the type of emergency at hand.

## Instructions

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    To run ETL pipeline that loads the source CSV files, cleans them and stores the cleaned resulting Pandas Dataframe in a database. Run the following under the data directory.

    ```python
    python process_data.py disaster_messages.csv disaster_categories.csv DisasterResponse.db
    ```

    To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves the model in a pickle file run the following from the models directory:

    ```python
    python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl
    ```

1. Run the following command in the app directory to run the web application in order to do predictions:

    ```
    python run.py
    ```

Then go to `http://0.0.0.0:3001/` to launch the web interface of the application

In the box on the top enter the message to classify and click on the "**Classify Message**" button.
